            <h2>About No-Face</h2>
            <p>No-Face is a fun, loveable, semi-transparent tubular spirit that hangs around the bathhouse, usually seen following Chihiro around. This guy is lonely and impressionable with an ominous expressionless mask for a face, he is usually heard speaking in grunts and moans. He has the ability to use the voice and ability of any creature he swallows. After causing a bit of trouble during his bathhouse adventure, he turns his attention to the peaceful activities of spinning and knitting as Zeniba's apprentice for the rest of his days.</p>
